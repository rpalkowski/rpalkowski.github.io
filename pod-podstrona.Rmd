```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.path='wykresy/',
                      fig.align='center', dpi = 300, tidy=TRUE,

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg, col = "red", pch = 15)
```
